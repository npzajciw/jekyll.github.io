    <h1> About Me </h1>
    <p> My name is Nicholas Zajciw. I am a graduating senior at U of M. My program
        of study has focused on the Modern Middle East and Islamic history. As I
        finish my studies at this university I look forward to heading into a new,
        but long enjoyed field: Startups! Outside of my interest in history, I
        have a passion for technology and the various roles it plays within our
        lives. I have channeled this interest into a company of my own, HiveLend.
        At www.hivelend.com I connect farmers and beekeepers for crop pollination.
        Having experience in beekeeping, my hope is that through building this
        website I will become better able to understand, communicate with, and
        work with web developers.

        I am also a fan of watching Tv and movies. I enjoy reading anything
        concerning technology, politics, and the economy. I also try to maintain
        an active lifesytle and am a fan of hiking, running, kayaking, and
        exploring the world around me.
